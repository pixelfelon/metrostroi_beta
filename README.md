Metrostroi Subway Train Simulator
================================================================================
A prototype of a subway simulator, based on Garry's Mod (Source Engine).
For the licensing information, see at the bottom.

It's a beta version of original Metrostroi Subway Train Simulator

This simulation features fully simulated 81-717 and Ezh3 metro trains - with all
the electric circuits and pneumatic systems. Every relay of the train is modelled.

The following features are incomplete/missing:

- 81-717 train is based on Ezh3 model and lacks some 81-717 specific features
(ventilation, proper BPSN modelling).
- Some 81-717 indicators are based on the manuals and might be connected
to slightly wrong circuits. 
- 81-717 circuit breakers are actually from Ezh3 and don't match up with
what they should really be in real train. 
- Emergency controls are not implemented.
- ARS/ALS system modelling is simplified and based on the manual and not electric circuits.
- While all perfomance data more or less matches real world one, some changes
had to be made for it to work nicely with Garry's Mod maps.
